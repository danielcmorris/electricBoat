# ElectricBoat

This project was developed to assist people to do some performance modeling with their boats

## Origin

The system primary origin is from and excel sheet called, "PERFORMANCE MODELING SPREADSHEET FOR ELECTRIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS IN DISPLACEMENT MONOHULL BOATS"

initially found here: [Thunderstruck EV](http://www.thunderstruck-ev.com/Manuals/EBOAT%20MODEL%20SPREADSHEET.xls)

## Goal

I'd like to simply make some of these formulas a bit more user friendly and perhaps support the community a bit.  I'll be adding in some references to my own boat and the vendors who have provided me with support over the transition from diesel to electric.
