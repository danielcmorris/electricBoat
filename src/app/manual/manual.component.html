        <p>

            This is the first draft of a predictive performance model for planning electric boat installations in
            displacement
            monohull boats. I am an audio/video engineer used to working with complex mathematical models for room
            acoustics and
            performance predictions for sound systems and projection systems. Naval architecture and sailing are
            hobbies. I have
            been researching and playing with electric conversion calculations for a couple of years now. But most of
            the rule
            of thumb tables and simple equation sets for estimating performance under power are geared for IC engines
            and there
            has not been a simple coherent approach for modeling the power transfer characteristics of an electric
            propulsion
            system. The math involved in computational fluid dynamics of propulsion versus hull drag makes my brain go
            numb and
            my eyes glaze over after about an hour. This stuff can't be fully calculated in Excel and most people
            wouldn't have
            the required data for their hulls anyway. So I am hoping to come up with simplified rules of thumb
            calculations and
            data tables that will apply to most situations and get close enough results, say +/-10% or so that people
            can have
            some confidence when they plunk down the big bucks for the hardware.
            Any predictive model is based on a set of underlying conditions to control the number of variables. This one
            is no
            different. The model parameters are as follows.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hull performance data
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterline length and displacement entries are used to calculate speed length ratios and
                        estimated hull
                        resistance.</li>
                    <li>Beam and hull depth entries are used to calculate optimum prop size.
                    </li>
                    <li>Prismatic coefficient is not used directly in calculations at this point.</li>
                    <li>The speed/length ratio calculations are well known. The actual limiting ratio for displacement
                        hulls is
                        as high as 1.54 depending on hull design. The classic 1.34 ratio is just a point on the curve,
                        but a
                        practical one for most small boats as the power curve goes almost vertical beyond that point.
                        Most
                        efficient cruising speeds are going to be below 1.10 for most common hull types. The model
                        calculates
                        speed in knots referenced to speed length ratios based on the LWL entry.</li>
                    <li>e. Hull drag estimates are based on tables and equations in an article by Ted Brewer in the July
                        2004
                        edition of Good Old Boat. They apply only to modern sailboats with Prismatic coefficients
                        between .54
                        and .58. Waterline lengths to beam ratios for such hulls are typically around 2.5-3:1. Older
                        heavy
                        displacement full keel hulls will have about 5% or so higher drag figures. These figures also
                        assume a
                        clean smooth hull.
                    </li>
                    <li>f. The horsepower calculation is for the actual minimum power required at the prop shaft for a 3
                        blade
                        prop of about 55% efficiency. No allowances are included for reserve power, drive system losses
                        or
                        accessories. It is reasonably accurate according to my correspondence with prop manufacturers.
                        The
                        requirements are the same regardless of the power source driving them.
                    </li>
                    <li>g. There is a table for entering towing test results in Lbs. If you want accurate results I
                        highly
                        recommend measuring the actual drag of your hull at various speeds with a spring scale between
                        your boat
                        and the tow vessel. The estimated drag will at least suggest an appropriate range for the spring
                        scale.
                        Use a GPS set to read speed in Knots instead of onboard instruments.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Propeller Model and Data Entry:
                <ul>
                    <li>a. The model suggests a close to optimally efficient prop size, shaft speed, and pitch based on
                        the hull
                        model data. It is included as a suggested starting point for selecting an appropriate propeller.
                        Performance calculations are based on the data entry fields.
                    </li>
                    <li>b. The prop data fields allow entry of size and shaft speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>c. Valid shaft speed range for this model is 100-300rpm per knot of boat speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>d. For best efficiency one should fit as large a diameter propeller as possible. The limiting
                        factors on
                        diameter are usually available torque, maximum draft limits, and tip clearance to the hull or
                        prop
                        aperture. Optimum tip clearance is generally accepted as 1/3rd the diameter of the prop.
                        Brewer’s rule
                        of thumb for minimum tip clearance is 10% of prop diameter plus one inch.
                    </li>
                    <li>e. Sailors may want to reduce prop size or blade area to minimize drag under sail. Small props
                        turning
                        at high speed will have much greater cavitation and turbulence losses resulting in prop
                        efficiencies
                        closer to the 35% range than the 55% range. This model will not predict those losses
                    </li>
                    <li>f. Pitch is automatically calculated for a 55% slip factor. This conforms to a basic law of
                        Newtonian
                        physics that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. At any given steady state
                        cruising speed, the mass x velocity squared plus thermodynamic losses of water flowing aft in
                        the slip
                        stream is exactly equal to the mass x velocity squared plus thermodynamic losses of the water
                        displaced
                        by the boat moving forward, I.E. 50% slip. There is a 5% fudge factor for losses due to
                        turbulence and
                        prop cavitation.
                    </li>
                    <li>g. Determining the ultimate optimum pitch for a particular IC engine and boat at full power is a
                        real
                        black art. For a given throttle setting an IC engine produces constant torque. Engine speed and
                        horse
                        power vary with the load. Over pitch the prop and you lose RPMs and power. Under pitch the prop
                        and you
                        over rev the engine. Props may vary in thrust response by a few of inches of pitch one way or
                        the other
                        due to differences in foil design. The manufacturers use voodoo to figure this stuff out. This
                        is not an
                        issue with series wound electric motors because the power response is exactly the opposite.
                        Apply a
                        known voltage and the motor is going to turn at a constant RPM. Current demand will vary as
                        needed to
                        meet the actual torque load. Lock the motor shaft in a vise and the current demand and torque
                        will rise
                        toward infinity right up to the point where the weakest link in the system blows up (hopefully
                        that will
                        be a fuse). Since there is no significant change in available power with small changes in pitch
                        response, compared to simply adjusting the motor speed, there is little reason to depart from
                        the
                        theoretical optimum. So the model balances prop diameter against shaft speed to meet the power
                        requirements of a particular design. Pitch is maintained at theoretical optimum.
                    </li>
                    <li>h. If one absolutely can’t find a practical combination of prop and reduction gear to meet the
                        power
                        requirements, the rule of thumb for pitch adjustment is 2 inches of pitch = 1 inch of diameter.
                        Unfortunately the standard prop equations will not model the variation in thrust for pitch
                        adjustments
                        alone. You are on your own here.
                    </li>
                    <li>i. The shaft horsepower and thrust calculated from these fields should match or exceed the hull
                        drag and
                        estimated HP to achieve a given speed. These results are used to spec an appropriate motor,
                        reduction
                        gear, and system voltage to meet power requirements.

                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>3. MOTOR AND DRIVE SPECIFICATION
                <ul>
                    <li>a. The motor variables used in the calculations are the torque constant in Ft. Lbs per Amp and
                        the
                        voltage constant in RPMs per Volt. These are usually listed in the motor specifications under no
                        load
                        and maximum load. They can also be derived from the motor data charts that plot RPM and Current
                        at a
                        constant voltage with varying torque loads.
                    </li>
                    <li>b. The voltage constant determines the speed of rotation for a specific voltage input. This
                        speed will
                        be maintained within a very narrow range for any torque load up to the maximum peak torque
                        output of the
                        motor.
                    </li>
                    <li>c. The torque constant in Lbs/Ft determines the current demand in amps for a given torque load
                        applied
                        to the motor shaft. The current required will be the same for a given torque load regardless of
                        motor
                        speed. Actual torque load is determined by the prop. If the torque specifications are listed in
                        Newton
                        meters (Nm) or lbs/inch there are conversion tables to change this to Lbs/Ft.
                    </li>
                    <li>d. The drive reduction ratio variable will determine specific RPM and torque demand on the motor
                        for a
                        given prop shaft speed. From this the required motor voltage and current are calculated. This is
                        where
                        you match your available maximum system voltage and current limits to the drive train.
                    </li>
                    <li>e. Power input to the drive system will always be greater than power output. The motor
                        efficiency rating
                        determines thermodynamic losses in the motor. An arbitrary 4% loss is added to estimate bearing
                        losses
                        in the drive train and thermodynamic losses in the controller. These numbers are used to
                        calculate power
                        demands on the controller and battery compared to actual power output at the prop.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>CONTROLLER SPECIFICATION
                <ul>
                    <li>a. Controller specs are there for visual comparison with calculated data. They are not directly
                        involved
                        data calculations.
                    </li>
                    <li>b. Be sure to spec a controller with generous reserve current capacity for reliable operation at
                        continuous cruising speeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>c. As a conservative designer I would want a controller with short term peak current capacity
                        that
                        matches or exceeds the motor’s short term peak current capacity. If you plan on continuous run
                        times
                        longer than one hour, the current demand for long term cruising should be around 50-70% of the
                        one hour
                        rating of the controller.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>BATTERY SPECIFICATION
                <ul>
                    <li>a. The individual battery voltage and Amp hour rating at the standard 20 hour discharge rate are
                        used
                        along with the Peukert factor to estimate run times in minutes for 50% depth of discharge, 80%
                        depth of
                        discharge and 100% depth of discharge.
                    </li>
                    <li>b. The string voltage is the maximum nominal system voltage available to the controller from
                        individual
                        batteries wired in series.
                    </li>
                    <li>c. The total number of batteries in the system must equal at minimum the number batteries in
                        series to
                        achieve string voltage. Batteries added in parallel to increase total amp hour capacity must be
                        even
                        multiples of the number in series.
                    </li>
                    <li>d. Peukerts factors can range from a low of around 1.08 for AGM batteries to a high of around 2
                        for some
                        flooded cell batteries. I have entered a mid range number that should be reasonable for most
                        high
                        quality marine grade deep cycle batteries. If you can find out from the manufacturer what the
                        Peukert
                        number is for your battery, enter that number in the data table.
                    </li>
                    <li>e. String current calculations are derived from the system KW rating after losses.
                    </li>
                    <li>f. Battery current calculations show the actual current demand for individual batteries in the
                        string
                        and are used to calculate run times incorporating the Peukert factor.
                    </li>
                    <li>g. Runtime calculations assume new batteries in fully charged condition.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL
                <ul>
                    <li>a. The performance predictions are based on steady state cruising speeds for optimal
                        displacement hulls
                        in calm flat water conditions. No winds, no waves, no currents.
                    </li>
                    <li>b. There is no assumption that the results given will match the actual performance of any
                        particular
                        boat or propulsion system.
                    </li>
                    <li>c. This model assumes optimum conditions of the overall system: new components, proper
                        installation,
                        adequate wiring, etc.

                    <li>d. Performance predictions reflect absolute minimum requirements with generally accepted minimum
                        allowances for overall system thermodynamic losses. There are no reserves built in.

                    <li>e. The user should regard this as a planning tool and allow for appropriate reserve capacities
                        to meet
                        changing conditions with respect to intended use.

            I hope this will prove to be a generally useful design tool for planning electric installations in small
            boats. By
            reducing the design process to a coherent set of known basic requirements we will be free to explore range
            of
            possibilities available for our intended application with confidence that results will be what we intended.
            The
            first edition is a theoretical tool only and has not been tested or verified by comparison to existing real
            world
            installations. I would appreciate any feedback that will help further refine this model including testing
            against
            real world data from existing boat owners. If in using this spreadsheet you discover any errors or omissions
            or have
            suggestions for improvements please e-mail me so I can correct them
